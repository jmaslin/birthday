Although he played 15 seasons in the major leagues, almost entirely for four American League teams, Berg was never more than an average player, usually used as a backup catcher, and was better known for being \"the brainiest guy in baseball\" than for anything he accomplished in the game. Casey Stengel once described Berg as \"the strangest man ever to play baseball\".\nA graduate of Princeton University and Columbia Law School, Berg spoke several languages and regularly read 10 newspapers a day.",
