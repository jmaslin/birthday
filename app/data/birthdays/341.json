A major figure in the world of architecture, he was the leading sculptor of his age, credited with creating the Baroque style of sculpture.

In addition, he was a painter (mostly small canvases in oil) and a man of the theater: he wrote, directed and acted in plays (mostly Carnival satires), also designing stage sets and theatrical machinery, as well as a wide variety of decorative art objects including lamps, tables, mirrors, and even coaches.",
