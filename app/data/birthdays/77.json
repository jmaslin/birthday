      "aboutText": "Dylan Mattingly (born March 18, 1991 in Oakland, California) is an American composer from Berkeley, California. His music draws from a diverse range of styles and musicians, and he himself says that he \"is influenced alike by John Coolidge Adams, Olivier Messiaen, Magnus Lindberg, Joni Mitchell, and the old American blues and folk field recordings of the Lomaxes.\" Composer John Coolidge Adams describes Dylan Mattingly as: “a hugely talented young composer who writes music of wild imagination and vigorous energy.” Mattingly was the co-director of Formerly Known as Classical for two years—a youth-run new music organization which played only music written within their lifetimes, and is currently the co-artistic director, and cellist, of Contemporaneous, a new music ensemble based in New York “dedicated to performing the most exciting music of this generation.” Contemporaneous has released an album on INNOVA Records, entitled Stream of Stars—Music of Dylan Mattingly.",
