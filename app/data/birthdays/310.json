Instead, using concepts drawn from physiognomy, degeneration theory, psychiatry and Social Darwinism, Lombroso's theory of anthropological criminology essentially stated that criminality was inherited, and that someone \"born criminal\" could be identified by physical (congenital) defects, which confirmed a criminal as savage or atavistic.",
