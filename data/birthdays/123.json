Educated and first published in Germany, he married Western European influences to purely Georgian thematic to produce his best works, such as The Right Hand of the Grand Master and David the Builder. Hostile to the Soviet rule, he was, nevertheless, one of the fewest leading Georgian writers to have survived Stalin-era repressions, including his exile to a White Sea island and several arrests.",

In August 2014 he changed his political allegiance to UKIP and announced his resignation as an MP, thereby necessitating a by-election in which he stood and was returned as a UKIP MP. He explained that he was joining UKIP out of a desire to see \"fundamental change in British politics\" and because he believed \"many of those at the top of the Conservative Party are simply not on our side.",
