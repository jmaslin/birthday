The publication of this model in his book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) just before his death in 1543 is considered a major event in the history of science, triggering the Copernican Revolution and making an important contribution to the Scientific Revolution.\nCopernicus was born and died in Royal Prussia, a region that had been a part of the Kingdom of Poland since 1466.",
