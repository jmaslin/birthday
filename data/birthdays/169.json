Uday was seen, for several years, as the likely successor to his father, but lost the place as heir apparent to Qusay due to injuries sustained in an assassination attempt, increasingly erratic behavior, and his troubled relationship with the family.\nHis reputed actions include multiple allegations of rape, murder and torture (including of Iraqi Olympic athletes and the national football team).",
