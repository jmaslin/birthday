As a songwriter, Blades brought the lyrical sophistication of Central American nueva canción and Cuban nueva trova as well as experimental tempos and politically inspired Nuyorican salsa to his music, creating \"thinking persons' (salsa) dance music\".\nBlades has composed dozens of musical hits, the most famous of which is \"Pedro Navaja\", a song about a neighborhood thug who is killed by a very attractive street walker he actually knows (he tries to kill her, she shoots him, they both die, a bum finds them, and takes his belongings; Blades' song \"Sorpresas\" continues the story), inspired by \"Mack the Knife\".",
